			A link to BearMaps can be found <a href = "http://cs61b.ug/sp16/materials/proj/proj3/proj3.html" target ="_blank"> here. </a> The project was inspired by Google Maps: I wrote the back end and made graphics to the front end of the project. There are two major components to the project: rastering, the process of converting query requests into bit-mapped, pixel-by-pixel images, and routing, drawing the distance between two locations. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I used an A* algorithm to compute the shortests paths from one specific location to another. I've also done the gold points for this project, which were <b> autocompletion </b> and <b> search. </b> I learned how to modularize my data and to effectively apply my data structures!

		A link to Text Editor can be found <a href = "http://cs61b.ug/sp16/materials/proj/proj2/proj2.html" target ="_blank"> here. </a> You're probably familiar with different text editors: some of them allow you to edit un-styled text (e.g., Notepad and TextEdit), and others have amazing features that allows for a perfect user friendly experience (e.g., Microsoft Word and Google Docs). For this project, I implemented a basic text editor that can be used to open, edit, and save my text files.
		</p>
		<p> My favorite part of this project was learning how to implement <b> selection. </b> I learned from this project that even something simple to use can be quite a challenge!
