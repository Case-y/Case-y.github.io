			<strong>Course: CS 61B </strong>
			A link to this project can be found <a href = "http://cs61b.ug/sp16/materials/proj/proj3/proj3.html"> here. </a> The project was inspired by Google Maps: I wrote the back end and made graphics to the front end of the project. There are two major components to the project: rastering, the process of converting query requests into bit-mapped, pixel-by-pixel images, and routing, drawing the distance between two locations. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I used an A* algorithm to compute the shortests paths from one specific location to another. I've also done the gold points for this project, which were <b> autocompletion </b> and <b> search. </b>
