	<strong>March 2016: </strong> </br>
	My team (shoutout to Ken Chen and Vanessa Ng) and I were at The Big Hack 2016 from April 8th - April 9th. We built an app based on the prompt provided by a non-profit organization known as Watsi. Check out the proposed challenge <a href = "https://quip.com/WLZcAY684akN" target = "_blank"> here</a> </br>
	</p>
	<p>
	We were very excited and inspired by Watsi's mission to give back to the world through donations, and created a mobile app called "Wake Up, World!" Wake Up World was compiled through Xcode and is in a language of Swift2. Graphics are designed using Adobe Illustrator. <a href = "/creative/wakeupworld"> Read More </a>

	<strong>December 2015: </strong> </br> 
	Inspired by <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique"> the Pomodoro Technique, </a> I made my own website that resembles a Pomodoro time management system (Of course, I kinda tried to make it stylish... but I hope it looks bright and cool?). This time management technique uses a timer to alternate between intervals of work and intervals of rest. The user can also customize the length of each Pomodoro.

	<strong>November 2015: </strong> </br>
	Math is a pretty cool subject, at least to me it is! So I made a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers. I was also motivated by the aesthetics of nature and wanted to incorporate a forest like setting to my calculator. (I guess that's where the style came from?)
