	<h2> Wake Up World </h2>
	<p> My team (shoutout to Ken Chen and Vanessa Ng) and I were at The Big Hack 2016 from April 8th - April 9th. We built an app based on the prompt provided by a non-profit organization known as Watsi. Check out the proposed challenge <a href = "https://quip.com/WLZcAY684akN" target = "_blank"> here </a> </br>
