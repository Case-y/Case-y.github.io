		<p> Julian is amazing: I give him an A* Rating (if you get the reference!) </br>
		I'm really glad to have met Julian because I wouldn't be able to even start my own personal website (BTW, that's not the only reason... he's a super awesome person!). He guided me through what I needed to know and all about web domains. I really appreciate all of what he has done for me!

		<p> Angela has been one of my <i> second </i> best friends at UC Berkeley. She's also from Boulder, Colardo and is the one of the few people who's willing to stay up with me to do work! I actually don't know how we met, but I'm glad that we did ^____^ Thanks for the moral support! She gave me constructive crictism in a really mean way... HAHA I'm just kidding Angela!

		<p> Rachel is the best! </br>
		She's very design oriented and creative: I haven't met anyone either person who does animation and art as well as she can! Rachel helped me come up with how my website should look like, taking into account both UI and UX approaches. She also designed the metallic background for me. :)

		<p> Hi Vivian!!! Wait, what's with the camera? Oh... Okay! Lights, Camera, Action! 
		</br>
		Vivian is from Singapore and has been a great friend of mine at UC Berkeley. She takes photoshoots whenever she has the time! So one day, I just asked her to take photos of me at different locations on campus. The photo I'm using in my 'about' page happens to be one of the photos she took!

		<p> Free Code Camp is a really great resource!
		</br> 
		For a clueless beginner like me, I haven't had any idea where to start learning how to freelance / create websites! When I stumbled upon <a href = "freecodecamp.com" target = "_blank"> freecodecamp, </a> I was blessed by its clear and informational instructions for web designing! I recommend people to take a look at the website: in fact, most of my web design projects originated from there!
