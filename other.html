		<p> Julian is amazing: I give him an A* Rating (if you get the reference!) </br>
		I'm really glad to have met Julian because I wouldn't be able to even start my own personal website (BTW, that's not the only reason... he's a super awesome person!). He guided me through what I needed to know and all about web domains. I really appreciate all of what he has done for me!

		<p> Angela has been one of my <i> second </i> best friends at UC Berkeley. She's also from Boulder, Colardo and is the one of the few people who's willing to stay up with me to do work! I actually don't know how we met, but I'm glad that we did ^____^ Thanks for the moral support! She gave me constructive crictism in a really mean way... HAHA I'm just kidding Angela!

		<p> Hi Vivian!!! Wait, what's with the camera? Oh... Okay! Lights, Camera, Action! 
		</br>
		Vivian is from Singapore and has been a great friend of mine at UC Berkeley. She takes photoshoots whenever she has the time! So one day, I just asked her to take photos of me at different locations on campus. The photo I'm using in my 'about' page happens to be one of the photos she took!
