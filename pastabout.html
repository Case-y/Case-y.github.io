		Hi, I'm a first-year undergraduate at UC Berkeley currently studying Computer Science. Growing up from Cerritos, California, my passion is to bring world change through technology. By fall 2016, I will have completed three semesters of relevant coursework in the form of five computer science courses, all of which are relevant to coding practical programs and applications. Some of the topics (all of which I'm really into) include algorithms, optimizations, interpreters, space / time complexity, and data structures. My goal after graduation is to work in a field of software engineering. In the meantime, I've been working on mobile and web apps. </br> 
		Some of my other interests are running, baking, snapchatting, writing, and thinking. Oh and, eating. :)
